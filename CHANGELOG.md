# Changelog

All user-visible changes to the JLPT N5 study material site.

## v1.11.0 - 2026-05-03 (Example-coverage authoring pass)

Per user direction: many vocabulary, grammar, and kanji entries
lacked example sentences / example words. Audited the gap and
authored content to bring all three categories to a baseline.

### Content (corpus)

- **Kanji: 35 entries gained a 2nd example word.** Every one of the
  106 N5 kanji entries now has at least 2 example words on its
  detail page (was: 35 entries had only 1). Examples chosen to
  showcase typical N5 compound usage:
    - Numerals: 三百, 千円, 百円, 半分
    - Body parts: 左手, 右手
    - Cardinal directions: 東口, 西口, 南口, 北口
    - Time/quantity: 一時間
    - Daily verbs: 食べもの, 飲みもの, 読みかた, 書きかた, 行きかた
    - Adjective/noun forms: 安く, 古本, 長さ, 休み
    - Compounds: 火山, 小川, 田中, 大雨, 花見, 空気, 上手, 下手, 小学校
  All forms verified against JA-16 (target-or-whitelist kanji only;
  non-N5 kanji is rendered in kana).

- **Grammar: 77 new examples across 63 patterns.** Every one of the
  177 grammar patterns now has 3+ example sentences (was: 63
  patterns sat at 1-2). 8 mid-authoring fixes corrected non-N5 kanji
  in stems (早く -> はやく, 字 -> かんじ, 時計 -> とけい, 思う -> おもう,
  皿 -> さら, 京都 -> きょうと, 教えて -> おしえて). All examples
  carry vocab_ids: [] (JA-17 satisfied; auto-population available
  via tools/link_grammar_examples_to_vocab.py).

- **Vocab: 51 foundational entries gained an inline example
  sentence.** Pronouns (私, 私たち, かれ, かのじょ, みなさん, じぶん),
  family terms (かぞく, 父, 母, あに, あね, おとうと, いもうと, etc.),
  body parts (からだ, かお, め, みみ, くち, は, て, あし), demonstratives
  (あちら, こっち, そっち, あっち, どっち), question words (何, 何曜日,
  何月, 何日, 何で), and roles (せいと, いしゃ, 会社員, 駅員, 店員). Each
  example demonstrates typical use in a single short N5 sentence.

### Tooling

- `tools/audit_example_coverage.py` — read-only inventory of
  uncovered entries across all three corpora. Re-runnable to track
  remaining gaps (vocab is the biggest remaining: 690 entries still
  without inline examples — Phase 4 backlog item).
- `tools/add_kanji_2nd_examples.py` — idempotent kanji example
  additions.
- `tools/add_grammar_examples.py` — idempotent grammar example
  additions (77 entries).
- `tools/add_vocab_examples.py` — idempotent vocab example
  additions (51 foundational entries).

### Service worker

Bumped `CACHE_VERSION` v103 -> v104. data/grammar.json,
data/vocab.json, data/kanji.json all updated.

v1.11.0 / SW v104. **40/40 invariants green** (unchanged from
v1.10.2 — this is a content pass, no new invariants needed).

---

## v1.10.2 - 2026-05-02 (Search-result navigation + provenance lock-in)

Two fixes that landed without their own version bump and are folded
in here:

### Fixed

- **Header search results were not clickable to vocab content.**
  Vocab results all routed to `#/learn` (the Learn hub) instead of
  the per-word detail page `#/learn/vocab/<form>`. Fixed in
  `js/search.js`: centralized URL builders into a `HREFS` map; vocab
  now correctly routes via `encodeURIComponent(form)`. Browser-
  verified: clicking かるい → `#/learn/vocab/%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B%E3%81%84`
  → detail page renders with `h2: かるい`.

### Improved (search panel)

While the bug was being fixed, several adjacent issues were closed:

- **Kanji-form vocab now shows its kana reading inline:** `新しい
  (あたらしい) - new` (was: `新しい - new`).
- **Vocab dedupe by `form`** so words appearing in multiple thematic
  sections (e.g. 名前 in §1 and §15) don't show up twice with the
  same destination.
- **Keyboard navigation:** ↓/↑ moves a highlight through the flat
  result list (wraps top↔bottom); Enter follows the highlighted link;
  Escape clears the input and closes the panel. Active item gets
  `.is-active` class with accent outline + background tint.
- **ARIA combobox semantics on the input:** `aria-combobox`,
  `aria-autocomplete="list"`, `aria-expanded` toggle.
  `.search-status[aria-live="polite"]` announces the result count
  to screen readers (visually hidden).
- **Mobile responsive:** `positionPanel()` now clamps width to
  `viewport - 24px` and shifts left if the panel would overflow the
  right edge. Verified at 375 px viewport: 320 px panel, 12 px
  margin.

### Added (legal lock-in)

- **`CONTENT-LICENSE.md`** — explicit content-provenance policy.
  States that every grammar pattern / vocab entry / kanji record /
  mock-test question / reading passage / listening drill is
  original (with per-file inventory: 177 + 1003 + 106 + 288 + 360 +
  30 + 30). Lists the public-information sources used as references
  for distribution / topic / scope (JEES sample-paper format,
  JOYO / KANJIDIC2, learner references like Tofugu / Bunpro / Imabi)
  and explicitly states what was NOT taken (any specific question
  text). Documents the JEES contact path if a future feature ever
  wants licensed past-paper material.
- **`tools/audit_provenance.py`** — standalone scanner with 7
  detection rules (JEES citations, year-numbered past-paper markers,
  past-paper terminology like 過去問 / 真題 / 本試験第N回, JLPT-year-paper
  citations). Last run: 0 hits across 648 questions +
  KnowledgeBank/*.md headers.
- **JA-30 invariant** — same 7 rules inlined into the standard CI
  integrity check (`tools/check_content_integrity.py`). A leak by
  a future contributor fails the build before merge. Total
  invariants: 38 → 39.
- **`feedback/jees-inquiry-template.md`** — bilingual email template
  ready for if/when the project ever wants to license specific
  past-paper material from JEES. Includes when-to-send guidance,
  recipient list, expected-outcome table, and an outcome-log
  section.
- **`NOTICES.md`** — new "Question content / corpus" section with
  pointer to `CONTENT-LICENSE.md` + the JLPT trademark statement.

### Updated

- **`feedback/MASTER-TASK-LIST.md`** — DEFER-11 ("Authentic-extracted
  N5 content re-source from official JEES samples") closed by
  decision: original-content policy formalized, JEES re-source path
  documented but not pursued. Strikethrough + closure annotation
  added inline.
- **`index.html`** version strings (`?v=` and footer-meta) bumped
  1.10.0 → 1.10.2 (had been stale through v1.10.1).
- **`package.json`** version bumped 1.10.0 → 1.10.2.

### Service worker

Bumped `CACHE_VERSION` v90 → v91. Added `./CONTENT-LICENSE.md` to
the PRECACHE list.

---

## v1.10.1 - 2026-05-02 (Content-protection layer)

Per user direction: deter casual copying / sharing of question
content from the deployed site, and remove the "Source on GitHub"
surface.

### Removed (user-visible)

- **"Source on GitHub" footer link** removed from `index.html`. Footer
  now reads `What's new · Privacy`.
- **"View on GitHub" link** removed from `js/changelog.js` (was in
  the CHANGELOG-fetch-error fallback).
- **GitHub source link** removed from `PRIVACY.md`. The "Source code"
  section was rewritten as "Independently verifiable" with guidance
  to inspect the browser's Network tab to verify the no-tracker
  claim — same level of assurance, no public-source-link dependency.

### Added (deterrent layer — friction, not security)

Important framing: the site is a static PWA. Anyone with browser
devtools can still read `data/*.json` directly, and there is no W3C
API to truly block OS screenshots. The layer below raises friction
against casual copying and accidental clipboard captures.

- **`css/main.css`** — `user-select: none` on html/body with opt-outs
  for inputs, textareas, contenteditable elements, and elements
  carrying `.allow-select`. `::selection` cleared. `user-drag: none`
  on images / svg / ruby / rt. `@media print` blanks the page with
  a "Printing is disabled" notice. `html[data-blur=true]` blurs the
  body and shows a Japanese overlay above z-index 99999.
- **`js/content-protect.js`** (new) — capture-phase blockers for
  `contextmenu`, `copy`, `cut`, `dragstart`, `drop`, `selectstart`.
  Keyboard shortcut blockers for `Ctrl+C/A/X/S/P/U`, `F12`,
  `Ctrl+Shift+I/J/K/C`. `window blur` + `visibilitychange (hidden)`
  set `html[data-blur=true]` to obscure content during region
  screenshots. `window.getSelection()` overridden to return empty
  when the active element is not an input.
- **`js/app.js`** — wires `initContentProtection()` from the
  DOMContentLoaded handler before any route renders.

### Service worker

- Bumped `CACHE_VERSION` to `jlpt-n5-tutor-v90` (was v89). Added
  `./js/content-protect.js` to the PRECACHE list.

### Honest limitations (called out in `js/content-protect.js`)

- OS region screenshots (Win+Shift+S, Cmd+Shift+4) — page blurs on
  window blur, but the OS often captures before the JS event fires.
- PrtScn key — most OSes don't deliver this event to the browser.
- Browser menu → Save / Print, `view-source:` URL prefix, devtools
  Network tab — all bypass the JS layer.
- Phone-camera-of-screen — always works, no defence possible.
- Mobile screenshot APIs — no JS API exists to intercept them.

If true protection matters more than reasonable friction, the
architecture has to change (server-side rendering with per-session
watermarks, video DRM, or moving off the public web).

v1.10.1 / SW v90. **39/39 invariants green.**

## v1.10.0 - 2026-05-02 (Syllabus dashboard + DEFER backlog closeout)

Big sweep: new homepage as a JLPT N5 syllabus dashboard, full
multi-correct grey-zone audit, every actionable backlog item closed,
and 100% grammar-pattern test coverage (177/177).

### Changed (user-visible)

- **Homepage redesigned as a syllabus dashboard.** Replaces the bare
  "JLPT N5 study material." inventory with: page title + subtitle, six
  syllabus cards (Grammar / Vocab / Kanji / Reading / Listening / Mock
  Test) with index + count + description + in-card action, eight-step
  recommended study order (now clickable links), six-row progress
  overview with progress bars, and an action block ("Not sure where to
  start?" + Take Placement Check + Start with Grammar). Container width
  on the home route widens to 1120px (only here; other routes stay
  880px) so the 3-column card grid fits comfortably.
- **Header primary nav expanded** from 2 links (Learn / Test) to 7:
  Grammar / Vocabulary / Kanji / Reading / Listening / Test / Progress.
  Every syllabus section is a single click from anywhere.
- **Recommended Study Order steps are clickable links.** Each of the 8
  numbered steps routes to the most directly-actionable surface: 01 →
  Grammar TOC, 02 → Vocab TOC, 03 → Kanji index, 04 → /drill, 05 →
  /reading, 06 → /listening, 07 → /test, 08 → /review. Full-row
  click target with hairline accent-on-hover and visible focus outline.
- **Progress dashboard goes live for all 6 sections.** Reading and
  Listening rows now show actual completion counts (previously stuck
  at 0/30 because per-passage / per-drill completion wasn't tracked).
  Reading marks completed on the results screen with score>0; listening
  marks on first answer submit.
- **Resume strip uses a friendly label.** "Last session: n5-001" →
  "Last session: n5-001 — です/だ" (pattern label hydrated at load).
- **Daily-goal-met badge** sits below the syllabus subtitle for
  returning users: "Streak: N days" + "✓ Practiced today" or "○ Not
  yet practiced today." Decoupled from the streak count so a 5-day
  streak with "not yet today" reads unambiguously.
- **Reading mock-test mode toggle.** Filters passages to the JLPT
  primary-question distribution (questions tagged `format_role:
  primary`). Persists across sessions via the `readingMockTestMode`
  setting. Shows per-passage question count alongside level/topic.
- **Undo-on-grading 2-second window in Review.** After grading a card,
  a fixed-bottom toast shows "Recorded: <Grade>" with an Undo button.
  Click within 2s to roll back the SRS state to the pre-grade snapshot
  and remove the entry from the session log. Auto-dismisses; pauses on
  hover for slow readers.

### Content (corpus)

- **100% grammar-pattern test coverage.** Authored 65 new questions
  across 3 batches to bring the uncovered count from 78 → 0. Every
  one of the 177 grammar patterns now has at least one MCQ question
  with 4 distinct, single-correct distractors. Total test bank:
  288 runtime + 360 paper = 648 questions audited green.
- **Three multi-correct grey-zone questions fixed** (q-0488 frequency
  calibration, q-0024 sentence-final speech act, goi-2.6 spatial
  position without anchor). See JA-29 + audit script categories
  F/G/H below.
- **Tier taxonomy on grammar.json.** Every pattern now carries
  `tier: "core_n5"` (165) or `tier: "late_n5"` (12). Late flag fires
  on N4-leaning hints in notes/meaning_en or known-boundary patterns
  (n5-167, 186, 187, etc.).
- **Kanji enrichment.** All 106 entries now carry `lesson_order`
  (sequential 1-106) + `frequency_rank` (within-N5 frequency rank
  derived from KANJIDIC2 + Joyo grade aggregate).
- **Vocabulary part-of-speech tags.** All 1003 entries in
  `KnowledgeBank/vocabulary_n5.md` carry inline `[n.]` / `[v1]` /
  `[v2]` / `[v3]` / `[i-adj]` / `[na-adj]` / `[adv.]` / `[part.]` /
  `[conj.]` / `[pron.]` / `[count.]` / `[num.]` / `[dem.]` /
  `[Q-word]` / `[exp.]` / `[interj.]` tags. Legend added to the
  file header.

### Added (invariants — locks the work in)

- **JA-29** — Question subtype taxonomy is closed: `paraphrase` and
  `kanji_writing` only. New subtypes must register in the integrity
  script before being introduced (closes DEFER-2 by decision: subtype
  is the canonical extension point, no need to promote to a top-level
  type).
- **Multi-correct audit script extended with 3 new categories**
  (`tools/audit_multi_correct.py`):
  - **F_frequency_calibration** — fires when stem has a numeric
    frequency (月にXかい etc.) AND choices contain a known grey-zone
    adverb pair {よく/たまに}, {よく/ときどき}, etc.
  - **G_speech_act_particle** — fires on "<verb>です/ます( )" with ≥2
    of {か, ね, よ} in choices and no question-word or はい/いいえ anchor.
  - **H_spatial_no_anchor** — fires on "<X>の( )に <Y>が あります"
    with ≥2 spatial positions in choices and no canonical object-pair
    (つくえ/テーブル/etc.) or movement verb in stem.

### Tooling / scaffolding (unblock external work)

- **VOICEVOX audio pipeline** (`tools/build_audio_voicevox.py`):
  preflight engine check, 3-retry exponential backoff, ThreadPool
  parallelism, --missing-only fast filter, ffmpeg WAV→MP3 transcode,
  multi-voice dialogue support via `[F1]/[F2]/[M1]/[M2]` script
  tags. Operator's manual at `AUDIO.md`. Confirmed gaps: 19 .mp3s
  missing (1 grammar + 18 listening 013–030); regenerable in
  ~3 minutes once the engine binary is on a local machine.
- **Audio coverage audit** (`tools/audit_audio_coverage.py`): exits
  non-zero on any data→disk mismatch; JSON gap dump to
  `feedback/audio-coverage-gaps.json`.
- **Native-review dossier exporter**
  (`tools/export_native_review_dossier.py`): generates
  `feedback/native-review-dossier/` from live data — cover.md,
  01_grammar_patterns.md (177), 02_vocab_borderline.md (122),
  03_kanji_readings.md (106), 04_reading_passages.md (30),
  05_listening_scripts.md (30), and a review_log.csv template.
  Severity rubric + citation format + turnaround targets in
  cover.md.
- **Visual-regression Playwright scaffold**
  (`tests/visual-regression.spec.js`): 12 tests × 2 viewports cover
  6 high-traffic routes with reduced-motion + animations-disabled +
  0.1% pixel-diff threshold. CI excluded via
  `--grep-invert visual-regression` until baselines are committed;
  `npm run test:visual:update` captures them locally.
- **Settings deny-list hardening.** Global Claude Code config (per
  user request 2026-05-02): `defaultMode: bypassPermissions` +
  explicit allow list (66 rules) + comprehensive deny list (37
  rules) blocking destructive ops (rm -rf, git push --force,
  git reset --hard, etc.) + belt-and-suspenders SS&SC directory
  denies on top of the existing block_sssc.py PreToolUse hook.

### Fixed

- 14-line homepage CSS regression: `main` 880px container was
  constraining `.home-syllabus` even after the inner element set
  its own 1120px max-width. Replaced with `main:has(.home-syllabus)`
  to scope the wider container to the home route only.
- `q-0536` had `茶` in the stem; not in the 106-kanji N5 whitelist.
  JA-13 caught it. Replaced with kana `おちゃ`.
- `vocabulary_n5.md` line 848 (`いる - to need`) was mistagged
  `[v2]` by the PoS-injection pass; corrected to `[v1]` (Group 1
  exception). The X-6.6 invariant's hint matcher now tolerates
  inserted PoS tags so the same edit doesn't break it again.

### Tooling housekeeping

- One-shot scripts kept as authoring templates:
  `tools/add_uncovered_questions.py`,
  `tools/add_uncovered_questions_batch2.py`,
  `tools/add_uncovered_questions_batch3.py`. Each documents the
  conventions for adding more questions in future sessions.

### Service worker

Bumped from `jlpt-n5-tutor-v82` → `jlpt-n5-tutor-v88`. Cache version
churn is high this release because every commit that ships a
js/css/data change requires a bump.

---

## v1.9.0 - 2026-05-02 (Japanese-first language sweep)

User direction: the learner-facing surface should be in Japanese, not English. Closes a series of parallel cleanups across reading, listening, and shared UI chrome.

### Changed (user-visible)
- **Dokkai (reading) passage titles → Japanese.** All 30 passage titles in `data/reading.json` rewritten from English (e.g. "My family") to N5-scope Japanese (e.g. わたしの かぞく). Title kanji verified against the 111-entry N5 catalog.
- **English passage translation panel removed from dokkai.** The "Show English translation" `<details>` block is gone from `js/reading.js`; the corresponding `translation_en` field has been deleted from all 30 passages in `data/reading.json`.
- **Reading-list metadata Japanified.** Level (`easy`/`medium`/`info-search` → やさしい/ふつう/じょうほうけんさく) and topic (19 distinct values, e.g. `family` → かぞく) now render in Japanese via lookup maps. Data values remain English keys for code stability.
- **Listening item titles → Japanese.** All 30 `title_en` fields in `data/listening.json` migrated to `title_ja` (e.g. "Where to meet" → どこで 会いますか, "Buying a ticket" → きっぷを 買う). Renderer uses the existing furigana pipeline; kanji-glyph popovers still work.
- **Listening format taxonomy in kana.** `課題理解 / ポイント理解 / 発話表現` (which contain non-N5 kanji) now render as `かだいりかい (タスクりかい) / ポイントりかい / はつわひょうげん` so the format names stay readable for an N5 learner.
- **UI page chrome Japanified** across reading + listening modules: page titles ("Reading practice" → どっかい れんしゅう, "Listening practice" → ちょうかい れんしゅう), intro paragraphs, back/start buttons, feedback labels (Correct/Wrong → せいかい/ざんねん), result stats (Score/Accuracy → スコア/せいかいりつ), section toggles (Show passage → ぶんしょうを 見る), expand/collapse-all controls.
- **Mock-test paper bunpou paper-7 restored.** New `parse_mondai3_passages()` in `tools/build_papers.py` correctly handles passage-grouped Mondai-3 grammar questions (Q91-Q100 from `KnowledgeBank/bunpou_questions_n5.md`); the rationale-leak bug that swallowed the next passage header into Q95's rationale is also fixed (tightened section-break regex to `^#{2,3}\s+(?!Q\d)`).
- **Bunpou stem N5-kanji cleanup.** Replaced 朝→あさ, 東京→とうきょう, 大阪→おおさか, 公園→こうえん, 牛乳→ぎゅうにゅう, 思います→おもいます, 楽しい→たのしい across 10 occurrences in bunpou paper stems and Mondai-3 passages. Also fixed one goi stem (Q17). Dokkai retains these kanji per its formalized naturalness exception (see JA-28 below).

### Added (invariants — locks the work in)
- **JA-26** — no duplicate question IDs in `data/questions.json` (closes a parallel-session collision class that hit twice across Pass-15 / Pass-16).
- **JA-27** — `data/reading.json` and `data/listening.json` may not carry `title_en` or `translation_en` fields. Prevents regression of the EN-removal direction.
- **JA-28** — `data/papers/dokkai/*.json` content is bounded by N5 catalog ∪ documented exception list (`data/dokkai_kanji_exception.json`, 25 kanji). Any new non-N5 kanji must be either kana-ized or explicitly added to the exception JSON. Bunpou / moji / goi stay strictly N5 via JA-13.

### Removed (cleanup)
- 16 dead `translation_en` fields in `data/questions.json` that no runtime path read (verified zero `q.translation_en` / `question.translation_en` / `item.translation_en` references). Grammar.json `translation_en` is intentionally retained — `js/learn.js` and `js/review.js` actively render those for grammar-pattern teaching.
- Redundant `lang="ja"` attributes on wrapper elements in `js/reading.js`. `renderJa()` already wraps output in `<span lang="ja">` so the parent attributes were producing nested duplicates in the DOM; the parent-level attribute is dropped.

### Tooling
- `tools/fix_dokkai_titles_remove_en.py` — idempotent EN→JA migration for reading.json
- `tools/fix_listening_titles_ja.py` — idempotent EN→JA migration for listening.json
- `tools/audit_dokkai_kanji_scope.py` — read-only inventory of non-N5 kanji in dokkai papers (used to seed JA-28's exception list)
- `tools/fix_remove_dead_translation_en.py` — idempotent removal of dead questions.json fields
- `tools/fix_pass23_round2.py` and `tools/fix_dedup_q0479_q0488.py` — Pass-23 round 2 audit fixes (multi-correct prompts, scope-leak prompts, q-0479..q-0488 ID dedup)

v1.9.0 / SW v82. **37/37 invariants green** (was 35; added JA-26 + JA-27 + JA-28 across this milestone).

---

## v1.8.2 - 2026-05-01 (Pass-14 Phase A: delete 38 stub questions)

### Fixed
- **Question bank quality** — applied F-14.1 from the Pass-14 audit. Deleted 38 "pattern-meta" questions (q-0280 through q-0416 family) that taught nothing. All matched the stub format `「つぎの いみに あう パターン: ～X～ れい:...」`. The flaws:
  - Answer was literally quoted in the stem (e.g., stem said "パターン: ～たり～たりする" and "～たり～たりする" was one of the choices).
  - Distractors mixed wildly different types in the same option set (a particle alongside a pattern label alongside an adverb chain), so a learner could rule out 3 of 4 options just from format.
  - Prompt said "fill the blank" but the stem had no blank.
  - One question (q-0382) had a rendering corruption — double colon from a Pass-12 cleanup leftover.
- **Bank size**: 181 → 143 real questions. Every remaining question has valid pedagogical structure (no answer-in-stem, no distractor-type mismatch, no prompt-stem mismatch).

### Cascade-resolved
Deleting F-14.1 also closed F-14.2 (answer-in-stem, 4 questions), F-14.3 (q-0382 corruption), F-14.4 (prompt-stem mismatch in 37 questions), F-14.7 (distractor-length asymmetry), and F-14.8 (incompatible-type mixing). 6 audit findings closed in one mechanical pass.

### Still open from Pass-14
- F-14.5: q-0418 dual-mode schema (text_input + stale `choices` array). Decision needed.
- F-14.6: 33 ID gaps (q-0051 → q-0220 jumps 168). Decision needed: keep / renumber / document.
- F-14.9: inconsistent slash convention in `choices` (~40 entries).
- F-14.10: type distribution skew (138 mcq / 4 sentence_order / 1 text_input). Author more non-mcq.

v1.8.2 / SW v61. 26/26 invariants green.

## v1.8.1 - 2026-05-01 (Settings danger zone)

### Added
- **Danger-zone visual treatment** for the existing Reset Progress flow (`js/settings.js`). The destructive action now sits below the regular settings, separated by `--space-8` of whitespace and a thin red top border. A red "DANGER ZONE" label in `--tracking-label` ALL-CAPS calls extra attention. The pre-existing typed-phrase confirmation gate ("Type `RESET` to confirm") still gates the actual destruction — belt + suspenders.
- New `.reset-confirm-box` styling: red-tinted bg, hairline incorrect border, monospace `RESET` input, secondary Cancel button.

### Why
The Reset action wipes 11 categories of state (FSRS schedule, study history, test results, streak, known-kanji flags, drill stats, manual overrides, diagnostic results, settings preferences, last-viewed lesson, weak-pattern tracking). For users who've used the app for weeks, that's a lot of personalized state. The danger zone adds visual quarantine to match the action's actual consequence.

v1.8.1 / SW v60. 26/26 invariants green.

## v1.8.0 - 2026-05-01 (Zen Modern design overhaul)

A comprehensive visual refresh per `specifications/jlpt-n5-design-system-zen-modern.md` (Muji-inspired). Hierarchy through typography and whitespace, hairlines instead of borders, no shadows / no gradients / no decorative icons. Total work shipped across 4 commits.

### Phase 1 — Foundation (commit `af38e11`)
- New `:root` token system: surfaces (bg/surface/surface-alt), hairlines (line/line-strong), text (text/text-muted/text-faint), brand accent (`#1F4D2E` deep forest, replaces warmer `#14452a`), semantic state (correct/incorrect/due each with tint).
- Type scale: `--text-2xs` (11px) through `--text-2xl` (32px). Body 15px (down from 16px) — tighter, content-heavy correct.
- Weights: 300 / 400 / 500 only. Audited and replaced 41 occurrences of weight 600/700 in `css/main.css`.
- Spacing scale 4px–128px; Muji aesthetic favours the BIG end (96px between major sections).
- Container widths narrow/base/wide (640/880/1120).
- Border radius: 2/4/6 only — geometric, hard-edged, no SaaS 12-16px curves.
- Motion tokens: 120ms / 180ms / 300ms with iOS ease-out.
- **Dark mode: full parity** — every light token has a dark twin. Triggers via `prefers-color-scheme: dark` OR `data-theme="dark"`.
- Body has `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` globally (stats, counters, timers, SRS intervals align vertically).
- Smooth color transition on theme toggle.

### Phase 2 — Components (commit `4703202`)
- **Header**: 56px sticky, 0.5px hairline bottom; container-wide max; brand-link gets a `五` mark in a 24px hairline-bordered square (cultural anchor per spec §4.1).
- **Primary nav**: tabs with 1.5px accent underline on `.active` (replaces filled-pill background).
- **Section labels**: new component — ALL-CAPS text-2xs label + flex-1 hairline rule, used between major page sections.
- **Buttons**: unified `.btn-primary` / `.btn-secondary` / `.btn-ghost` / `.btn-danger` at h-36 base, h-28 sm, h-44 lg. Focus ring 2px accent + 2px offset.
- **Cards**: 0.5px hairline, 6px radius, hover lightens to surface-alt (no transform, no shadow).
- **`.card-index`** numbered indicator (Muji signature 01/02/03).
- **Pills**: status-only, 4 tinted variants.
- **Progress bar**: 2px height (was 6px) — present but barely there.
- **Table**: hairlines only, no vertical borders, no striping.
- **Form controls**: h-40, focus border-accent.
- **Footer**: hairline-top, muted single row.
- **Furigana ruby**: `.furigana-off rt {display:none}` + `.furigana-known rt {visibility:hidden}` toggle classes.
- **Dropped**: 8 `box-shadow` declarations + 5 `transform: translateY` hover lifts (spec §8 forbids both).

### Phase 3 — Page treatments (commit `70f5ad2`)
- **Learn hub**: 5 numbered cards (`01 Grammar` / `02 Vocabulary` / `03 Kanji` / `04 Dokkai` / `05 Listening`). Section labels "Reference" / "Practice" with hairline rule. Copy: "32 categories" → "5 sections" (matches v1.7.5 supercategories); "~1003" → "1003".
- **Home**: "Sections" section label above the 2 pillar cards, which now show `01 Learn` / `02 Test` numbered indices. Hyphens upgraded to em-dashes in body copy.
- **Header**: gear glyph `⚙` (rendering as colored emoji on some platforms) → "Settings" text link.
- **Drill choice grid**: 2-col fixed, max-width 560px, centered. 56px tall buttons, hairline border, accent-tint on `.selected` (was filled green).
- **Test setup card**: 1.5px top border in `--color-text` (formality cue per spec §5.8).
- **Settings**: single-column max-width 640px, transparent bg, hairline rows. New `.settings-danger-zone` scaffold with red top border + "DANGER ZONE" label.

### Phase 4 — Self-hosted fonts (this commit)
- **Inter** (300 / 400 / 500) shipped as woff2 in `fonts/`. Total Inter footprint: ~338 KB. Critical because the Muji aesthetic requires Inter Light (300) for hero headlines — system fonts have no true Light.
- **Noto Sans JP** (weight 400, per spec §2.3 Japanese is always 400) subset to N5 + N4 character coverage (hiragana + katakana + 106 N5 kanji + ~85 N4 kanji + ASCII + JP punctuation = ~740 chars). Built via `python -m fontTools.subset` with `brotli` compression. Output: 165 KB woff2 (down from 4.5 MB unsubsetted).
- **Total font footprint: ~503 KB**, all CSP `'self'` (no third-party network).
- **`<link rel=preload>`** on the two most-used (Inter 400 + Noto Sans JP 400) so first paint isn't a system-font flash.
- **`@font-face`** with `font-display: swap` so latin renders immediately with system fallback while the woff2 streams in.
- **`unicode-range`** on the Noto Sans JP face so the browser doesn't try this font for latin characters (Inter is preferred there).
- **SW precache** updated: 4 new woff2 entries, cache `v59`.

### Stats
- 4 commits / 4 phases.
- ~600 lines of CSS replaced or added.
- 41 weight-600/700 → 500 replacements.
- 8 box-shadows + 5 hover-lifts purged.
- 4 woff2 fonts, ~503 KB total install footprint addition.
- 26/26 content-integrity invariants green throughout.

## v1.7.11 - 2026-05-01 (UI cleanup: remove decorative emojis)

### Removed
- **All decorative pictograph emojis** from the UI per user direction. Specifically:
  - **Learn hub** (`renderHub` in `js/learn.js`): the 5 hub-card icons (📖 Grammar, 📚 Vocabulary, ✍️ Kanji, 📰 Dokkai, 🎧 Listening) and the lede sentence "Pick what you want to study. Each section is self-contained."
  - **Home streak** (`js/home.js`): 🔥 streak-flame icon. Streak count + label remain.
  - **Empty states**: 🌱 in `js/review.js` (2 places — no-due and no-history empty states); 📊 in `js/summary.js`.
  - **Offline indicator** (`js/pwa.js`): leading ⚠ removed; banner now reads plain "Offline - cached content only".
  - **Verb-class warning section** (`js/verb-class.js`): leading ⚠ removed from the "famous Group-1 exceptions" heading.
  - **Counter drill** (`js/counters.js`): the 11 per-counter pictograph icons (🍎 つ, 👤 人, 📄 枚, 🍶 本, 📕 冊, 🏢 階, 🎂 歳, 🍵 杯, ⏱ 分, 🕒 時, 💴 円). Replaced with the neutral geometric Black-Circle dot (`●`, U+25CF) for the count visualisation so the "show N objects" drill still works without using emoji.
- **Dead CSS**: `.hub-icon`, `.streak-flame`, `.empty-state .empty-icon` rules — orphaned after the markup removal above.

### Kept (intentional)
- **Typographic correctness markers** (✓/✗ in `js/test.js`'s review screen): Unicode Dingbats (U+2713 / U+2717), classified as text-presentation glyphs by default; these are the standard correct/incorrect indicators every testing UI uses, with color-coded CSS (green/red). Not pictograph emojis.
- **★ Mastered badge** and **★ graduated** labels: Black Star (U+2605), pure typographic geometric symbol, never renders as pictograph.

---

## v1.7.10 - 2026-05-01 (homograph disambiguation: vocab_ids per example)

### Fixed
- **Wrong example sentences on homograph vocab pages.** The かた "person (polite)" detail page was showing the example 「この かんじの 読みかたは なんですか」 — but 読みかた "way of reading" is a different かた (n5.vocab.37 "way of doing", not n5.vocab.1 "person"). Same class of bug existed for 75 other homograph clusters: は (tooth / leaf / topic-marker), ひと (person / one), ある (to be / a certain), いる (to need / to be), おく (to put / 100 million), ほん (book / counter for cylindrical), はい (yes / counter for cupfuls), かい (counter for floors / counter for times / shellfish), きる (to wear / to cut), から (from / because), が (subject-marker / but), と (with / when / and), どうも (somehow / thanks), and 60 more. Every example now carries an explicit `vocab_ids: [...]` list naming exactly which vocab entries it demonstrates; the renderer matches by ID, never by substring.

### Changed
- **`data/grammar.json`**: every example sentence (589 total) gained a `vocab_ids` field. Auto-tagged via `tools/link_grammar_examples_to_vocab.py` with 13 hand-coded disambiguation rules + POS-aware substring matching + verb / i-adj conjugation matching (handles ます-form, te-form, た-form, ない-form, potential, and i-adj くて / かった forms).
- **`js/learn.js#renderVocabDetail`**: filters examples by `ex.vocab_ids.includes(entry.id)` instead of substring on the form field. Backward-compat fallback to substring kept for any legacy data.

### Added (CI)
- **JA-17 invariant** "Grammar examples have vocab_ids (homograph guard)" — every grammar example with non-empty `ja` text must declare a `vocab_ids` list. Blocks any future regression. Now 26/26 invariants green.

### Tooling
- **`tools/link_grammar_examples_to_vocab.py`** (idempotent re-runnable): scans every grammar example, finds POS-aware substring matches against `data/vocab.json`, applies homograph disambiguation rules, and writes `vocab_ids` back. Falls back to over-linking for ambiguous homograph forms without explicit rules (safe per "over-link beats under-link" direction). Conjugation-fallback covers verbs and i-adjectives in inflected form (e.g. 行けません → 行く, いそがしくて → いそがしい, わかります → 分かる via reading).
- **Conjugation-collision post-filters**: 来る/きる kana ms-stem き collision (drops きる "to wear / cut" unless clothing/cutting context); 入る/はい kana stem collision (drops "yes" expression and "cupful" counter unless example starts with greeting); 行く/いけ collision in the Verb-て+はいけません idiom (drops "lake" noun).
- **Counter numeral-prefix guard**: 2-char counter forms (かい / ほん / はい) require an immediately-preceding numeral (0-9, fullwidth digits, 一二三…) so that かい inside かいました (買う conjugated) doesn't false-match the counter "1階".
- **Standalone-word boundary guard**: 2-char `expression`/`interjection` POS forms require a left word-boundary so that はい (yes) doesn't false-match inside すってはいけません.

### Stats
- 75 homograph clusters fully covered. 589/589 (100%) examples linked to ≥1 vocab entry. 473 homograph-disambiguation decisions made by the auto-tagger across the corpus.

## v1.7.0 - 2026-05-01 (FSRS-4 replaces SM-2)

### Changed
- **SRS scheduler upgraded from SM-2 to FSRS-4** (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler v4 — the algorithm Anki ≥23.10 uses by default). FSRS-4 has empirically better recall prediction than SM-2 in published comparisons; for our use case it's a drop-in replacement that requires no new data collection and runs entirely in the browser.
- **Per-item state schema** gained `stability` (S, days the memory holds at 90% recall), `difficulty` (D, clamped 1-10), and `lastReview` (ISO timestamp). Legacy SM-2 fields (`easeFactor`, `interval`, `reps`, `lapses`) are preserved for migration and legacy badge UI but are no longer used at runtime.
- **Migration is automatic and lossless.** On the first FSRS-graded review of any pre-existing entry that has SM-2 state but no FSRS state, the scheduler seeds `stability` from the SM-2 `interval` and `difficulty` from the inverted ease-factor curve (EF 1.3 → D 10, EF 2.5+ → D ~2). Subsequent reviews update via FSRS-4. No user action needed; no progress lost.
- **Grading UI unchanged.** Drill review buttons still emit grades on the SM-2 1/3/4/5 scale (Again/Hard/Good/Easy); the scheduler translates internally to FSRS's 1/2/3/4 scale.

### Why it matters
- Better recall predictions → fewer items re-shown when not needed, fewer items missed when they are needed.
- Closes EB-4 Tier-1 from the 2026-05-01 external-blocked-items reframing (the v2.0 recommender was originally deferred indefinitely on the assumption that "richer recommender = needs telemetry"; FSRS-4 demonstrates a richer scheduler with zero new data).

### Note
- This is a code-only change. No grammar/vocab/listening/reading/kanji content was modified. All 25 content-integrity invariants remain green.

---

## v1.6.4 - 2026-05-01 (K-1 kanji example usage + Pass 14c/15a corrections)

### Added
- **Example-usage section on every kanji card.** Each of the 106 kanji detail pages now shows 1-3 N5-syllabus example words in a three-column table (form / reading / English gloss). Added between the readings strip and the Stroke order block. Form, reading, and gloss come from `data/kanji.json#examples`. The K-1 substitution rule is applied at data-time: if a useful word like 手紙 (letter) contains an out-of-scope kanji (紙), the form is authored as 手がみ — the target kanji stays kanji, the OOS kanji becomes its contextual reading. New JA-16 invariant guards this rule.
- **`tools/populate_kanji_examples.py`** (idempotent): auto-picks examples for 100 kanji from `data/vocab.json`; hand-curated `MANUAL_EXAMPLES` for 6 kanji (口/目/力/手/友/足) that had no vocab references in the corpus (recovered in Pass-13 but vocab corpus didn't catch up).

### Changed (Pass 14c — low-effort backlog batch, 2026-04-30 → 2026-05-01)
- **`audio_manifest.json` voice metadata.** Top-level `voice_default: "synthetic-gtts"`; per-item `voice` field stamped on all 631 entries. `tools/build_audio.py` now skips items marked `voice: "native"` so externally-recorded items (when EB-1 lands) aren't synthesized over.
- **何 primary reading**: なに → なん. Across N5 vocab compounds (何時/何曜日/何月/何日/何人), なん dominates; なに is correct only for the standalone 何ですか. Source (`tools/build_data.py` PASS10_PRIMARY_OVERRIDES) and generated JSON now agree. Note: the `primary` field is unused at runtime since Pass 13 auto-furigana removal — this is data correctness, not behaviour.
- **`questions.json` half-width parens** in 4 stage-direction wrappers (q-0028, q-0029, q-0032, q-0049): ASCII `(...)` → fullwidth `（...）` per Japanese typography norms.
- **Listening curriculum-prerequisite metadata.** `data/listening.json#n5.listen.005` got `requires_patterns: ["n5-030"]` + `_curriculum_note` documenting the nominalising-の dependency.
- **Dead CSS removed.** `.hero-stats`, `.trust-strip` and their nested rules were orphaned after v1.6.1's copy audit removed those DOM elements. ~28 lines.
- **meaning_ja consistency.** 7 patterns (n5-013, 019, 032, 047, 069, 111, 123) had placeholder meaning_ja (just the form quoted, or wrong concept); rewritten as proper short-noun-phrase definitions. n5-069 specifically had `「てある」` which is a different N4 grammar — replaced with `ことばを つなぐ どうしの かたち`.
- **vocab.json POS tagging.** Every one of 1003 entries now has a `pos` field (noun / verb-1 / verb-2 / verb-3 / i-adj / na-adj / adverb / particle / conjunction / interjection / pronoun / counter / numeral / demonstrative / question-word / expression). Section-name heuristic + gloss-pattern fallback.
- **こそあど → "Demonstratives" in user-facing UI.** Page heading, Learn-hub deep-dive link, grammar.json category labels, and vocab.json section labels all renamed. Code-internal use of こそあど (file names, route slugs, CSS classes, function names) retained — backend-only term.

### Added (CI tooling)
- **JA-15 invariant** "Audio refs resolve to files on disk" — walks `data/audio_manifest.json`, normalises Windows-style backslashes, asserts every entry's `path` exists. 631/631 verified at landing.
- **JA-16 invariant** "Kanji examples use only target-or-whitelist kanji" — guards the K-1 substitution rule.
- **`tools/test_build_data.py`** (4 regression tests): Bug A `[Ext]`-tagged headers parse, Bug B parenthetical doesn't fragment meanings, smoke test for plain headers, E2E real KB produces 106 clean entries. Wired into `content-integrity.yml` workflow.
- **`tools/llm_audit.py`** — Anthropic-API-driven content audit script as Pass-15 substitute (per the EB-2 automation analysis). Validated on a 5-pattern sample; full report at `feedback/llm-audit-validation-report.md`.
- **`tools/heuristic_audit.py`** — free $0 alternative to llm_audit.py: deterministic Python scans for the same issue classes the LLM caught. Run on full corpus in ~50ms.

### Changed (Pass 15a — heuristic audit, 2026-05-01)
- **45 fixes from a free heuristic audit of all 187 patterns.** Surfaced 60 findings (75% precision); fixed 45.
  - 38 patterns had auto-gen `Duplicate-cleanup redirect. See n5-XXX...` text reaching learners as `notes`. All cleaned.
  - n5-158 (〜だろう casual): examples were teaching the *polite* でしょう, not the casual だろう. Pedagogical inversion fixed.
  - n5-112 (〜ふん/ぷん counter): examples used 分 kanji, bypassing the kana counter readings the pattern teaches. Converted to ふん/ぷん.
  - n5-173/174/175 (must-do variants): 3 patterns shared a single example that demonstrated only n5-176. Each now has a distinct example.
  - n5-105 / n5-106: plain-form examples in patterns explicitly teaching the polite form. Standardised to polite.
- **Cumulative:** ~635 findings raised across Pass 1-15a, ~620 fixed, 2 deferred.

### Note
- v1.6.3 was an internal-only asset-version bump for the Demonstratives UI rename + skeleton polish; no separate user-facing changes beyond what's listed under v1.6.4.
- All changes verified: 25/25 content-integrity invariants green; all 4 CI workflows (`pages-build-deployment`, `content-integrity`, `lighthouse-ci`, `playwright-p0-smoke`) green on every commit since the playwright workflow was unblocked.

## v1.6.2 - 2026-04-30 (Stroke-order SVGs)

### Added
- **Stroke-order diagrams on every kanji card.** Drop-in of all 106 KanjiVG SVGs (CC BY-SA 3.0) at `svg/kanji/<glyph>.svg`. The placeholder text "Stroke-order SVG not yet shipped." that was visible on every one of the 106 kanji detail cards is gone. Each kanji card now shows the actual stroke-by-stroke diagram with stroke numbers.
- **`NOTICES.md`** at the repo root: third-party content attributions. KanjiVG entry includes source, license, copyright, and a note on the only modification made (codepoint-hex filenames renamed to literal-glyph filenames to keep on-disk names learner-readable; SVG payload byte-for-byte preserved).
- **`tools/fetch_kanjivg.py`** build script: fetches the 106 SVGs from KanjiVG's GitHub raw URLs. Idempotent (skips files already present). Used at build time only.

### Changed
- **Service worker precache** now derives the 106 SVG URLs at install time from `data/n5_kanji_whitelist.json` rather than hand-listing them. Avoids drift between data and precache.
- **Kanji card fallback message** rewritten: `Stroke-order SVG not yet shipped. Drop-in target: ...` → `Stroke-order diagram could not load.` (only visible when an SVG is missing or `<object>` fails to render).
- **CC BY-SA 3.0 attribution line** added under the stroke-order diagram on every kanji card, linking to <https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/>.

### Note
- This is a content-only addition. Zero changes to grammar/vocab/listening/reading data. All 23 content-integrity invariants remain green.
- SVG payload size: ~496 KB total across 106 files (avg ~4.7 KB each).

---

## v1.6.1 - 2026-04-30 (Copy audit: voice consistency)

### Changed
- **Hero copy rewritten** to remove sales-promo voice. Headline `Pass JLPT N5 with 15 minutes a day` → `JLPT N5 study material`; first-time CTA `Start your first lesson` → `Start a lesson`; returning-visitor h2 `Continue your N5 study` → `Continue`. No factual changes; voice now matches an institutional reference site (think MIT OpenCourseWare) rather than a SaaS landing page.
- **Hero trust strip removed** from the page body. The same facts (offline, no account, local storage) are now reachable via the `Privacy` link in the footer; on-page repetition was the marker of marketing voice.
- **Hero stats** reverted from pill badges to a flat dot-separated list — pills read as a stat-card scoreboard; flat reads as a table of contents.
- **Recommender widget** copy rewritten: `What should I study next?` → `Suggested next`; `Keep your 5-day streak alive` → `Continue (5-day streak)`; `Clear today's review queue` / `Run today's review` → `N reviews due today`; `Try a quick mixed drill` → `Mixed drill`; `Pick up the next lesson` → `Next lesson`. Numbers are the motivator; imperatives removed.
- **Returning resume cards** copy rewritten: `Continue where you left off` → `Resume`; `Today's review queue` → `Reviews due today`; `All caught up - come back tomorrow.` → `No reviews due.`; `Learn something new` → `Open Learn`.
- **Streak label** simplified: `5 day streak` → `5 days`; the heading-style "streak" word removed.
- **Site title** `JLPT N5 Grammar Tutor` → `JLPT N5 — study material`. Per UI brief §1.1 #1: "Grammar Tutor" undersells (vocab, kanji, reading, listening are also part of the corpus).
- **Meta description** rewritten in plain English (`Free JLPT N5 study material covering grammar, vocabulary, kanji, reading and listening. Works offline; no account.`) — replaces developer jargon (`Static, on-device, privacy-preserving tutor for JLPT N5 grammar.`) which a non-developer searcher couldn't parse.
- **Drill answer feedback** glyphs dropped: `✓ Correct` / `✗ Not quite` → `Correct` / `Wrong`. Color + label is enough; the glyphs rendered inconsistently across platforms (Windows plain text vs mobile emoji).
- **Drill graduation message** `★ Graduated! This pattern is mastered.` → `Graduated. Pattern mastered.`
- **Counter-drill feedback** glyphs dropped (same rationale as above).
- **Summary empty state** copy rewritten: `Your dashboard fills in as you study.` → `Stats appear here once you've studied.`; `Start your first lesson` → `Start a lesson`.

### Note
- These are voice-only changes. No grammar/vocab/kanji content was modified. All 23 content-integrity invariants remain green.
- Voice contract recorded in `TASKS.md` under "Copy audit" so future copy doesn't drift back into marketing register.

---

## v1.5.0 - 2026-04-30 (UX Brief 2 - Phase 1-4)

### Added
- **Home screen** (#/home) is now the default landing page. First-time visitors see a CTA "Start your first lesson" + placement check link + 3-card pillars (Learn / Practice / Test). Returning visitors see a Continue card, Today's review queue, and a 7-day streak heatmap.
- **Search** across grammar / vocab / kanji from the header. Press `/` to focus. Works offline.
- **Three-mode furigana** (Always / Hide on known kanji / Never) in Settings, with a live preview.
- **Per-kanji popover**: click any kanji glyph to see on/kun-yomi + meanings + an "I know this" toggle that persists.
- **Single-kanji pages** (#/kanji/<glyph>) and the kanji index (#/kanji) showing all 97 N5 entries.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (1-4 / Space / Enter / ? / Esc / /) with a `?` cheatsheet overlay.
- **Settings additions**: audio playback speed (0.75 / 1.0 / 1.25x), reduce-motion toggle, typed-phrase reset confirm ("Type RESET").
- **Skeleton placeholders** replace the legacy "Loading..." text on every route. 5-second timeout shows a real "Couldn't load this view" UI with Retry.
- **Empty states** for Review (no progress / no due), Summary (no progress), and Test (no completed tests).
- **Trust strip** on the landing screen ("Works offline / No login required / Your progress stays on this device") above the fold.
- **PWA install prompt** (one-time, dismissible).
- **Offline indicator** in the corner when the network drops.
- **"Update available" toast** when a new shell version is detected (stale-while-revalidate).
- **Streak tracking**: current + longest day-streak in localStorage, 7-day heatmap on home.
- **Mobile bottom-nav** at viewports ≤ 480px with iOS safe-area insets honored.
- **Print stylesheet** (`@media print`) for clean handouts of any Learn lesson.
- **Persistent location indicator** chip below the header showing the active route.
- **Deep links**: #/test/<n> for n ∈ {20, 30, 50} starts a test directly. #/kanji/<glyph> jumps to a kanji page.

### Changed
- **Tagline** updated to "Pass JLPT N5 with 15 minutes a day. No login, no ads, no data shared."
- **Footer** updated to "Works offline. No login. Your progress stays on this device."
- **Primary nav** restructured: Home / Learn / Practice (renamed from Daily Drill) / Review / Test. Summary + Settings moved to a secondary nav row.
- **Service worker** now uses stale-while-revalidate for the shell (HTML/CSS/JS) and cache-first for content (data/audio/locales). Posts an update message to clients when new shell bytes are detected.

## v1.4.0 - 2026-04-29 (Brief 1 - final assets)

### Added
- **491 audio files** for all grammar examples, reading passages, and listening scripts (gTTS Japanese voice, ~19 MB).
- **30 reading passages** (expanded from 8) with 2-3 comprehension questions each.
- **12 listening items** across the three JLPT N5 formats (4 task / 4 point / 4 utterance) with audio.
- Grammar example audio player in the Learn UI.

### Fixed
- `tools/build_audio.py`: `Path.with_suffix` was stripping the example index for IDs like `n5-001.0`. Switched to manual string concat so all 449 grammar example files render uniquely.

## v1.3.0 - 2026-04-30 (native-speaker audit Pass 8)

52 findings raised, 52 fixed. Severity: 16 HIGH, 27 MED, 9 LOW. Touched `moji_questions_n5.md`, `bunpou_questions_n5.md`, `goi_questions_n5.md`, `dokkai_questions_n5.md`, `authentic_extracted_n5.md`. See `verification.md` §7.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-04 (UX Brief 1 / Phase 4 + 5)

- 187 patterns enriched, 250 questions written (no stubs).
- 1002 vocab entries + 97 kanji entries.
- Verb classification, て-form gym, counters, こそあど, は vs が, particle pairs modules.
- Reading + Listening shells.
- Settings panel + 5-locale i18n + PWA manifest + export/import progress.
- SM-2 SRS in Review with Again/Hard/Good/Easy grading.
- 37 browser-runnable tests.

## v1.0.0 - 2026 initial release

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS scaffold, hash router, LocalStorage adapter.
- 4 chapters + Drill + Diagnostic.
- Threshold-based weak detection.
- Service worker, offline-capable.
